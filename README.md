# mikrotik-admin-whitelist
Mikrotik Admin Whitelist

**Usage:**

Create /etc/mtadmin.lst (or specify a different file by changing the list= variable).  This file may contain hostnames, IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, or IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR blocks.  Basic sanity checks are in place but proper values fall solely on you.

Change the dudeserver= variable to the IP address or hostname of your Dude Server.  Once your Dude Server is added to a device, it will not be removed when the address list is purged and rewritten.  This will prevent Dude Server disconnects when the address list is updated.     

Make the script executable and run.  Script will generate the file you specify by changing the file= value.

**Automation:**

It is recommended that you run the script with a cron job:

```
# Mikrotik Admin Whitelist Script

*/5 * * * * root /usr/local/bin/mtadmin
```

On each client device, use the scheduler to automatically download and import the whitelist as needed:

```
/system scheduler
add interval=5m name="adminwhitelist update" on-event="/tool fetch https://example.com/admin.rsc\
    \n/import admin.rsc" policy=read,write,test start-time=startup
```
