Mikrotik Admin Whitelist

# Usage:

Create /etc/mtadmin.lst (or specify a different file by changing the list= variable).  This file may contain hostnames, IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, or IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR blocks.  Basic sanity checks are in place but proper values fall solely on you.

Make the script executable and run.  Script will generate the file you specify by changing the file= value.
